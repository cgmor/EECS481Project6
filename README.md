# EECS481Project6
This is my repository for UMICH EECS-481 Project 6, where I worked with an open-source patent software package.

## 481 Staff:
I initially uploaded the unchanged PQAI files so that you have a baseline for my changes. I've made each changed file it's own commit so that you may see my documentation. I've also made changes to the .env file and some other config files, but did not upload any of that for security reasons.
